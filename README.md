One feature for an app that will help folks plan a vacation - display a list of national parks in an area.
 
Requirements:
- The user must be able to search for parks in one or more states.
- The user must be able to set the max number of results, with a default of 10.
- The search must trigger a call to NPS's API.
- The parks in the given state must be displayed on the page. Include at least:
  - Full name
  - Description
  - Website URL
- The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.

I've also added each park's addresses to the results.
